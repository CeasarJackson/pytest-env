pytest-env
=================

This is a py.test plugin that enables you to set environment variables in the pytest.ini file.

Installation
------------

Install with pip::

    pip install pytest-env

Uninstall with pip::

    pip uninstall pytest-env

Usage
-----

In your pytest.ini file add a key value pair with `env` as the key and the environment variables as a line 
separated list of `KEY=VALUE` entries.  The defined variables will be added to the environment before any tests are run:

    [pytest]
    env = 
        HOME=~/tmp
        RUN_ENV=test

You can use `D:` (default) as prefix if you don't want to override existing environment variables:


    [pytest]
    env = 
        D:HOME=~/tmp
        D:RUN_ENV=test
